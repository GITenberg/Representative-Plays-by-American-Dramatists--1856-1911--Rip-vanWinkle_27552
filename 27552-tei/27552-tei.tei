<p>
This is the history of the evolution of a play. Many hands
were concerned in its growth, but its increase in scenic effect
as well as in dialogue was a stage one, rather than prompted by
literary fervour. No dramatization of Washington Irving's
immortal story has approached the original in art of expression
or in vividness of scene. But, if historical record can be believed,
it is the actor, rather than the dramatist, who has vied with
Irving in the vitality of characterization and in the romantic
ideality of figure and speech. Some of our best comedians found
attraction in the rï¿½le, yet, though Charles Burke and James A.&nbsp;Herne
are recalled, by those who remember back so far, for the
very Dutch lifelikeness of the genial old drunkard, Joseph
Jefferson overtops all memories by his classic portrayal.
</p>

<p>
As far as literary value of the versions is concerned, it would
be small loss if none of them were available. They form a
mechanical frame-work as devoid of beauty as the skeleton
scarecrow in Percy Mackaye's play, which was based on Hawthorne's
<q>Feathertop</q> in <q>Mosses from an Old Manse.</q> It
was only when the dry bones were clothed and breathed into by
the actor's personality that the dramatizations lived. One
can recall no plot that moves naturally in these versions; the
transformation of the story into dialogue was mechanical, done
by men to whom hack-work was the easiest thing in the world.
Comparing the Kerr play with the Burke revision of it, when the
text is strained for richness of phrase it might contain, only one
line results, and is worth remembering; it is Burke's original
contribution,&mdash;<q>Are we so soon forgot when we are gone?</q>
</p>

<p>
The frequency with which <q>Rip Van Winkle</q> was dramatized
would indicate that, very early in the nineteenth century,
managers of the theatre were assiduous hunters after material
which might be considered native. Certainly <hi rend='italic'>Rip</hi> takes his place
with <hi rend='italic'>Deuteronomy Dutiful</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Bardwell Slote</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>Solon Shingle</hi> and
<hi rend='italic'>Davy Crockett</hi> as of the soil.
</p>

<p>
Irving's <q>Sketch Book</q> was published in 1819, and, considering
his vast interest in the stage, and the dramatic work done by
<pb n="025"/><anchor id="Pg025"/>
him in conjunction with John Howard Payne, it is unfortunate
that he himself did not realize the dramatic possibilities of his
story. There is no available record to show that he either
approved or disapproved of the early dramatizations. But there
is ample record to show that, with the beginning of its stage
career, nine years after publication, <q>Rip</q> caught fire on the
stage both in America and in London. Mr. James K.&nbsp;Hackett
is authority for the statement that among his father's papers is
a letter from Irving congratulating him upon having made so
much from such scant material.
</p>

<p>
The legendary character of Irving's sources, as traced in German
folk-lore, does not come within the scope of this introduction.
The first record of a play is Thomas Flynn's appearance as <hi rend='italic'>Rip</hi>
in a dramatization made by an unnamed Albanian, at the South
Pearl Street Theatre, Albany, N.&nbsp;Y., May&nbsp;26, 1828. It was
given for the benefit of the actor's wife, and was called <q>Rip
Van Winkle; or, The Spirits of the Catskill Mountains.</q> Notice
of it may be found in the files of the Albany <hi rend='italic'>Argus</hi>. Winter, in
his Life of Joseph Jefferson, reproduces the prologue. Part of
the cast was as follows:
</p>

<lg>
<l>Derrick Van Slous&mdash;Charles B. Parsons</l>
<l>Knickerbocker&mdash;Moses S. Phillips</l>
<l>Rip Van Winkle&mdash;Thomas Flynn</l>
<l>Lowenna&mdash;Mrs. Flynn</l>
<l>Alice&mdash;Mrs. Forbes</l>
</lg>

<p>
Flynn was a great friend of the elder Booth, and Edwin bore
Thomas as a middle name.
</p>

<p>
In 1829, Charles B. Parsons was playing <q>Rip</q> in Cincinnati,
Ohio, but no authorship is mentioned in connection with it,
so it must be inferred that it was probably one of those stock
products so characteristic of the early American theatre. Ludlow,
in his <q>Dramatic Life,</q> records <q>Rip</q> in Louisville, Kentucky,
November 21, 1831, and says that the Cincinnati performance
occurred three years before, making it, therefore, in
the dramatic season of 1828&ndash;29, this being Rip's <q>first representation
West of the Alleghany Mountains, and, I believe, the first
time on any stage.</q> Ludlow proceeds to state that, while in
New York, in the summer of 1828, an old stage friend of his
offered to sell him a manuscript version of <q>Rip,</q> which, on his
recommendation, he proceeded to purchase <q>without reading
<pb n="026"/><anchor id="Pg026"/>
it.</q> And then the manager indicates how a character part is
built to catch the interest of the audience, by the following bit
of anecdote:
</p>

<quote rend="display">
It passed off there [in Cincinnati] without appearing to create
any interest more than a drama on any ordinary subject, with the
exception of one speech, which was not the author's, but introduced
without my previous knowledge by one of the actors in the piece.
This actor was a young gentleman of education, who was performing
on the stage under the name of Barry; but that was not his real
name, and he was acting the part of <hi rend='italic'>Nicholas Vedder</hi> in this drama.
In the scene where <hi rend='italic'>Rip</hi> returns to his native village after the twenty
years of sleep that he had passed through, and finds the objects
changed from what he remembered them,&mdash;among other things the
sign over the door of the tavern where he used to take his drinks,&mdash;he
enquires of <hi rend='italic'>Vedder</hi>, whom he had recognized, and to whom he
had made himself known, who that sign was intended to represent,
saying at the same time that the head of King George III used to
hang there. In reply to him, instead of speaking the words of the
author, Mr. Barry said, <q>Don't you know who that is? That's
George Washington.</q> Then <hi rend='italic'>Rip</hi> said, <q>Who is George Vashingdoner?</q>
To which Barry replied, using the language of General
Henry (see his <q>Eulogy on Washington,</q> December 26, 1799),
<q>He was first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his
countrymen!</q> This woke the Cincinnatians up.
</quote>

<p>
Joseph Jefferson rejected this emendation later on, giving as
his reason that, once an audience is caught in the flare of a
patriotic emotion, it is difficult for an actor to draw them back
effectively to the main currents of his story. We have Ludlow's
statement to the effect that Burke's version was not unlike that
produced by him as early as 1828&ndash;29, in the middle West.
Could it have had any relationship to the manuscript by Kerr?
</p>

<p>
In Philadelphia, at the Walnut Street Theatre, on October&nbsp;30,
1829, William Chapman appeared as <hi rend='italic'>Rip</hi>, supported by Elizabeth
and J. (probably John) Jefferson. Winter suggests that the
dramatization may have been Ludlow's, or it may have been the
first draft of Kerr's. Though it is generally conceded that the
latter play was the one used by James H.&nbsp;Hackett, in a letter
received by the Editor from Mr. James K.&nbsp;Hackett, it is suggested
that his father made his own version, a statement not proved,
but substantiated by Winter.
</p>

<p>
The piece was given by Hackett, at the Park Theatre, New
York, on August&nbsp;22, 1830, and Sol Smith, in his <q>Theatrical
<pb n="027"/><anchor id="Pg027"/>
Management in the West and South,</q> declares, <q>I should despair
of finding a man or woman in an audience of five hundred, who
could hear [his] utterance of five words in the second act, <q>But
she was mine vrow</q> without experiencing some moisture in the
eyes.</q> While the <hi rend='italic'>Galaxy</hi>, in a later year, for February, 1868,
states: <q>His <hi rend='italic'>Rip Van Winkle</hi> is far nearer the ordinary conception
of the good-for-nothing Dutchman than Mr. Jefferson's, whose
performance is praised so much for its naturalness.</q> The statement,
by Oliver Bell Bunce, is followed by this stricture against
Jefferson: <q>Jefferson, indeed, is a good example of our modern
art. His naturalness, his unaffected methods, his susceptible
temperament, his subtleties of humour and pathos are appreciated
and applauded, yet his want of breadth and tone sometimes
renders his performance feeble and flavourless.</q> On the day before
its presentment by Hackett, the New York <hi rend='italic'>Evening Post</hi>
contained the following notice:
</p>

<quote rend="display">
Park Theatre, Mr. Hackett's Benefit. Thursday, 22d inst. First
night of Rip Van Winkle and second night of Down East.&mdash;Mr.
Hackett has the pleasure of announcing to his friends and the
public that his Benefit is fixed for Thursday next, 22d inst., when
will be produced for the first time the new drama of <q>Rip Van
Winkle; or, The Legend of the Kaatskill Mountains</q>&mdash;(founded
on Washington Irving's celebrated tale called <q>Rip Van Winkle</q>)&mdash;with
appropriate Dutch costumes; the River and Mountain scenery
painted by Mr. Evers, all of which will be particularly described in
the bills of the day.&mdash;Principal characters&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Rip Van Winkle</hi>, Mr.
Hackett; <hi rend='italic'>Knickerbocker</hi>, Mr. Placide; <hi rend='italic'>Vedder</hi>, Mr. Chapman; <hi rend='italic'>Van
Slous</hi>, Mr. Blakely; <hi rend='italic'>Herman</hi>, Mr. Richings; <hi rend='italic'>Dame Rip Van Winkle</hi>,
Mrs. Wheatley; <hi rend='italic'>Alice</hi>, Mrs. Hackett; <hi rend='italic'>Lowenna</hi>, Mrs. Wallack.
</quote>

<p>
Durang refers to the dramatist who is reputed to have done
the version for Mr. Hackett, as <q>Old Mr. Kerr,</q> an actor, who
appeared in Philadelphia under the management of F. C.
Wemyss. However much of an actor John Kerr was, he must
have gained some small reputation as a playwright. In 1818,
Duncombe issued Kerr's <q>Ancient Legends or Simple and
Romantic Tales,</q> and at the Harvard Library, where there is
a copy of this book, the catalogue gives Kerr's position in London
at the time as Prompter of the Regency Theatre. He must have
ventured, with a relative, into independent publishing, for there
was issued, in 1826, by J.&nbsp;&amp; H.&nbsp;Kerr, the former's freely translated
melodramatic romance, <q>The Monster and Magician; or,
<pb n="028"/><anchor id="Pg028"/>
The Fate of Frankenstein,</q> taken from the French of J. T.
Merle and A. N. Bï¿½raud. He did constant translation, and it is
interesting to note the similarity between his <q>The Wandering
Boys! or, The Castle of Olival,</q> announced as an original
comedy, and M. M. Noah's play of the same name.
</p>

<p>
There is valuable material in possession of Mr. James K.&nbsp;Hackett
for a much needed life of his father. This may throw light on his
negotiations with Kerr; it may also detail more thoroughly than
the records now show why it was that, when he went to England
in 1832, he engaged Bayle Bernard to make a new draft of the
piece, given in New York at the Park Theatre, September&nbsp;4,
1833. It may have been because he saw, when he reached
London, a version which Bernard had shaped for the Adelphi
Theatre, 1831&ndash;32, when Yates, John Reeve, and J.&nbsp;B. Buckstone
had played together. But I am inclined to think that, whatever
the outlines of the piece as given by Hackett, it was his acting
which constituted the chief creative part of the performance.
Like Jefferson, he must have been largely responsible for the
finished product.
</p>

<p>
Hackett's success in dialect made him eager for any picturesque
material which would exploit this ability. Obviously, local
character was the best vehicle. That was his chief interest in
encouraging American plays. Bayle Bernard had done writing
for him before <q>Rip.</q> In 1831, J. K. Paulding's <q>The Lion of the
West</q> had proven so successful, as to warrant Bernard's transferring
the popular <hi rend='italic'>Col. Nimrod Wildfire</hi> to another play,
<q>The Kentuckian.</q> Then, in 1837, Hackett corresponded with
Washington Irving about dramatizing the <q>Knickerbocker
History,</q> which plan was consummated by Bernard as <q>Three
Dutch Governors,</q> even though Irving was not confident of
results. Hackett went out of his way for such native material.
Soon after his appearance as <hi rend='italic'>Rip</hi>, the following notice appeared
in the New York <hi rend='italic'>Evening Post</hi>, for April&nbsp;24, 1830:
</p>

<quote rend="display">

<p>
Many such prize contests were the fashion of the day.
</p>

<p>
Mr. James K. Hackett, in reminiscence, writes: <q>My mother
used to tell me that Joe Jefferson played the part like a German,
whereas <hi rend='italic'>Rip</hi> was a North River Dutchman, and in those days
dialects were very marked in our country. But my father soon
became identified with the part of <hi rend='italic'>Falstaff</hi>, and he used to say,
<q>Jefferson is a younger man than I, so I'll let him have <hi rend='italic'>Rip</hi>. I
don't care to play against him</q>.</q>
</p>

<p>
A stage version of the Irving story was made by one John H.
Hewitt, of Baltimore, and during the season of 1833&ndash;34 was
played in that city by William Isherwood. It was after this
that Charles Burke (1822&ndash;1854) turned his attention to the play,
and, as is shown in the text here reproduced, drew heavily upon
Kerr. Winter says that he depended also upon the dramatic
pieces used by Flynn and Parsons. The date of the first essayal
of the part in New York was January&nbsp;7, 1850, at the New National
Theatre. But, during the previous year, he went with the
play to the Philadelphia Arch Street Theatre, where his half-brother,
Joseph, appeared with him in the rï¿½le of <hi rend='italic'>Seth</hi>. Durang,
however, disagrees with this date, giving it under the heading
of the <q>Summer Season of 1850 at the Arch Street Theatre,</q>
and the specific time as August 19. In his short career Burke
won an enviable position as an actor. <q>He had an eye and a
face,</q> wrote Joe Jefferson, <q>that told their meaning before he
spoke, a voice that seemed to come from the heart itself, penetrating&mdash;but
melodious.</q> He was slender, emaciated, sensitive,&mdash;and
full of lively response to things. Like all of the Jeffersons,
he was a born comedian, and critics concede that W. E. Burton
feared his rivalry. Between Burke and his half-brother, there
was a profound attraction; they had <q>barn stormed</q> together,
and through Burke's consideration it was that Joe was first
encouraged and furthered in Philadelphia. Contrasting Burton
and Burke, Jefferson wrote in his <q>Autobiography:</q>
</p>


<pb n="030"/><anchor id="Pg030"/>

<quote rend="display">
Burton coloured highly, and laid on the effects with a liberal
brush, while Burke was subtle, incisive and refined. Burton's features
were strong and heavy, and his figure was portly and ungainly.
Burke was lithe and graceful. His face was plain, but wonderfully
expressive. The versatility of this rare actor was remarkable, his
pathos being quite as striking a feature as his comedy. &hellip; His
dramatic effects sprung more from intuition than from study; and,
as was said of Barton Booth, <q>the blind might have seen him in his
voice, and the deaf have heard him in his visage.</q>
</quote>

<p>
But the height of Jefferson's praise was reached when he said:
<q>Charles Burke was to acting what Mendelssohn was to music.
He did not have to work for his effects, as I do; he was not
analytical, as I am. Whatever he did came to him naturally,
as grass grows or water runs; it was not talent that informed his
art, but genius.</q>
</p>

<p>
Such was the comedian who next undertook the rï¿½le of <hi rend='italic'>Rip</hi>.
How often his own phrase, <q>Are we so soon forgot,</q> has been
applied to the actor and his art! The only preservative we have
of this art is either in individual expressions of opinion or else
in contemporary criticism. Fortunately, John Sleeper Clarke,
another estimable comedian of the Jefferson family, has left an
impression of how Burke read that one famous line of his.
He has said:
</p>

<quote rend="display">
No other actor has ever disturbed the impression that the profound
pathos of Burke's voice, face, and gesture created; it fell
upon the senses like the culmination of all mortal despair, and the
actor's figure, as the low, sweet tones died away, symbolized more
the ruin of the representative of the race than the sufferings of an
individual: his awful loss and loneliness seemed to clothe him with
a supernatural dignity and grandeur which commanded the sympathy
and awe of his audience.
</quote>

<p>
Never, said Clarke, who often played <hi rend='italic'>Seth</hi> to Burke's <hi rend='italic'>Rip</hi>,
was he disappointed in the poignant reading of that line&mdash;so
tender, pathetic and simple that even the actors of his company
were affected by it.
</p>

<p>
However much these various attempts at dramatization may
have served their theatrical purpose, they have all been supplanted
in memory by the play as evolved by Jefferson and
Boucicault, who began work upon it in 1861. The incident told
by Jefferson of how he arrived by his decision to play <hi rend='italic'>Rip</hi>, as
his father had done before him, is picturesque. One summer day,
<pb n="031"/><anchor id="Pg031"/>
in 1859, he lay in the loft of an old barn, reading the <q>Life and
Letters of Washington Irving,</q> and his eye fell upon this passage:
</p>

<quote rend="display">
September 30, 1858. Mr. Irving came in town, to remain a few
days. In the evening went to Laura Keene's Theatre to see young
Jefferson as <hi rend='italic'>Goldfinch</hi> in Holcroft's comedy, <q>The Road to Ruin.</q>
 Thought Jefferson, the father, one of the best actors he had ever
seen; and the son reminded him, in look, gesture, size, and <q>make,</q>
 of the father. Had never seen the father in <hi rend='italic'>Goldfinch</hi>, but was
delighted with the son.
</quote>

<p>
This incident undoubtedly whetted the interest of Joseph
Jefferson, and he set about preparing his version. He had
played in his half-brother's, and had probably seen Hackett in
Kerr's. All that was needed, therefore, was to evolve something
which would be more ideal, more ample in opportunity for the
exercise of his particular type of genius. So he turned to the
haven at all times of theatrical need, Dion Boucicault, and talked
over with him the ideas that were fulminating in his brain. Clark
Davis has pointed out that in the Jefferson <q>Rip</q> the credits
should thus be measured:
</p>

<lg>
<l>Act I.&mdash;Burke + Jefferson + Boucicault ending.</l>
<l>Act II.&mdash;Jefferson.</l>
<l>Act III.&mdash;Burke + Jefferson + ending suggested by Shakespeare's</l>
<l rend='indent(4)'><q>King Lear.</q></l>
</lg>

<p>
But, however the credit is distributed, Jefferson alone made the
play as it lives in the memories of those who saw it. It grew by
what it fed on, by accretions of rich imagination. Often times,
Jefferson was scored for his glorification of the drunkard. He and
Boucicault were continually discussing how best to circumvent
the disagreeable aspects of <hi rend='italic'>Rip's</hi> character. Even Winter
and J. Rankin Towse are inclined to frown at the reprobate,
especially by the side of Jefferson's interpretation of <hi rend='italic'>Bob Acres</hi>
or of <hi rend='italic'>Caleb Plummer</hi>. There is no doubt that, in their collaboration,
Boucicault and Jefferson had many arguments about
<q>Rip.</q> Boucicault has left a record of the encounters:
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q>Let us return to 1865,</q> he wrote. <q>Jefferson was anxious to
appear in London. All his pieces had been played there. The
managers would not give him an appearance unless he could offer
them a new play. He had a piece called <q>Rip Van Winkle</q>, but
when submitted for their perusal, they rejected it. Still he was so
<pb n="032"/><anchor id="Pg032"/>
desirous of playing <hi rend='italic'>Rip</hi> that I took down Washington Irving's
story and read it over. It was hopelessly undramatic. <q>Joe</q>, I said,
<q>this old sot is not a pleasant figure. He lacks romance. I dare
say you made a fine sketch of the old beast, but there is no interest
in him. He may be picturesque, but he is not dramatic. I would
prefer to start him in a play as a young scamp, thoughtless, gay,
just such a curly-head, good-humoured fellow as all the village girls
would love, and the children and dogs would run after</q>. Jefferson
threw up his hands in despair. It was totally opposed to his artistic
preconception. But I insisted, and he reluctantly conceded. Well,
I wrote the play as he plays it now. It was not much of a literary
production, and it was with some apology that it was handed to
him. He read it, and when he met me, I said: <q>It is a poor thing,
Joe</q>. <q>Well</q>, he replied, <q>it is good enough for me</q>. It was produced.
Three or four weeks afterward he called on me, and his first words
were: <q>You were right about making <hi rend='italic'>Rip</hi> a young man. Now I
could not conceive and play him in any other shape</q>.</q>
</quote>

<p>
When finished, the manuscript was read to Ben Webster, the
manager of the Haymarket Theatre, London, and to Charles
Reade, the collaborator, with Boucicault, in so many plays.
Then the company heard it, after which Jefferson proceeded to
study it, literally living and breathing the part. Many are the
humourous records of the play as preserved in the Jefferson
<q>Autobiography</q> and in the three books on Jefferson by Winter
Frances Wilson and Euphemia Jefferson.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of September 4, 1865, at the London Adelphi,
the play was given. Accounts of current impressions are extant
by Pascoe and Oxenford. It was not seen in New York until
September&nbsp;3, 1866, when it began a run at the Olympic, and it did
not reach Boston until May&nbsp;3, 1869. From the very first, it was
destined to be Jefferson's most popular rï¿½le. His royalties, as
time progressed, were fabulous, or rather his profits, for actor,
manager, and author were all rolled into one. He deserted a large
repertory of parts as the years passed and his strength declined.
But to the very end he never deserted <hi rend='italic'>Rip</hi>. At his death the
play passed to his son, Thomas. The Jefferson version has been
published with an interpretative introduction by him.
</p>

<p>
When it was first given, the play was scored for the apparent
padding of the piece in order to keep Jefferson longer on the
stage. The supernatural elements could not hoodwink the
critics, but, as Jefferson added humanity to the part, and created
a poetic, lovable character, the play was greatly strengthened.
<pb n="033"/><anchor id="Pg033"/>
In fact Jefferson was the play. His was a classic embodiment,
preserved in its essential details in contemporary criticism and
vivid pictures.

<p>
[It is common knowledge that <q>Rip Van Winkle,</q> as a play,
was a general mixture of several versions when it finally reached
the hands of Joseph Jefferson. From Kerr to Burke, from Burke
to Boucicault, from Boucicault to Jefferson was the progress.
The changes made by Burke in the Kerr version are so interesting,
and the similarities are so close, that the Editor has thought
it might be useful to make an annotated comparison of the two.
This has been done, with the result that the reader is given two
plays in one. The title-page of the Kerr acting edition runs as
follows: <q>Rip Van Winkle; A Legend of Sleepy Hollow. A
Romantic Drama in Two Acts. Adapted from Washington Irving's
Sketch-Book by John Kerr, Author of <q>Therese</q>, <q>Presumptive
Guilt</q>, <q>Wandering Boys</q>, <q>Michael and Christine</q>, <q>Drench'd
and Dried</q>, <q>Robert Bruce</q>, &amp;c., &amp;c. With Some Alterations, by
Thomas Hailes Lacy. Theatrical Publisher. London.</q> The
Burke version, used here as a basis, follows the acting text, without
stage positions, published by Samuel French. An opera on
the subject of <q>Rip Van Winkle,</q> the libretto written by Wainwright,
was presented at Niblo's Garden, New York, by the
Pyne and Harrison Troupe, Thursday, September&nbsp;27, 1855.
There was given, during the season of 1919&ndash;20, by the Chicago
Opera Association, <q>Rip Van Winkle: A Folk Opera,</q> with
music by Reginald de Kovan and libretto by Percy Mackaye,
the score to be published by G.&nbsp;Schirmer. New York.]

<p rend="action">
<hi rend='italic'>Enter</hi> <name>Derric Van Slaus.</name><note place="end">
<q><hi rend='italic'>and</hi> <name>Herman</name></q> in K. The scene, which is different, runs as follows:

<lg>
<l><name>Herman.</name> Lecture me as much as you will, father, if at the close of your sermon you are prepared to supply me with the money that I need.</l>
<l><name>Derric.</name> Money! that is eternally your cry. Your extravagances have almost ruined and soon will dishonour me. Oh! I am but justly punished for my mad indulgence of a son who was born only to be my bane and curse.</l>
<l><name>Herman.</name> If you could but invent some fresh terms for my reproach! such frequent repetition becomes, I assure you, very wearisome.</l>
<l><name>Derric.</name> You have caused me to plunge into debt, and I am now pursued by a host of creditors.</l>
<l><name>Herman.</name> We must find a way to quiet them. And for the money I now require&mdash;</l>
<l><name>Derric.</name> Not another dollar do you obtain from me. Already, to supply your cravings, I have misappropriated some of the public money, and I must replace it soon if I would avert the shame and degradation with which I now am threatened.</l>
<l><name>Herman.</name> And from which I will save you.</l>
<l><name>Derric.</name> You?</l>
<l><name>Herman.</name> Yes. I! Rip van Winkle, your tenant&mdash;</l>
<l><name>Derric.</name> What has that idle, dissipated fellow to do with the present matter?</l>
<l><name>Herman.</name> Much, as I will show you, and his daughter more.</l>
<l><name>Derric.</name> His daughter?</l>
<l><name>Herman.</name> Now scarcely seven years old, I believe. This girl has an aunt residing in New York, who has long since, in consequence of an affront received from Van Winkle, discarded the whole family. But I have discovered that, of which they have no notion.</l>
<l><name>Derric.</name> What do you mean?</l>
<l><name>Herman.</name> Why, that the whole of this aunt's fortune, and she is immensely rich, must of necessity, at the old lady's death, become the inheritance of the little Lowena.</l>
<l><name>Derric.</name> And in what way can that affect us?</l>
<l><name>Herman.</name> You shall hear. I have already caused a contract to be prepared, and to which you must obtain Rip Van Winkle's signature.</l>
<l><name>Derric.</name> What is that contract?</l>
<l><name>Herman.</name> You shall read it presently. Van Winkle is an easy soul, and at present, I believe, your debtor.</l>
<l><name>Derric.</name> Yes, considerably in arrears with the rent of the tenement, which he holds from me.</l>
<l><name>Herman.</name> Obtain his signature to the contract I am about to give you, and 'twill be a security on which money may be raised to any amount.</l>
<l><name>Derric.</name> You amaze me, I&mdash;</l>
<l><name>Herman.</name> You must have cash, father, to relieve you from your unpleasant difficulties, and I, for those delights of youth without which there is no advantage in being young.           [<hi rend='italic'>Exeunt.</hi>]

<sp>
<speaker>Derric.</speaker><p>Should the present application fail, I am a ruined
man; all my speculations will be frustrated, and my duplicity
exposed; yes, the dissipation of my son must inevitably prove his
ruin as well as mine. To supply his wants, the public money has
been employed; and, if unable to replace it, heaven knows what
may be the consequence. But my son is now placed with an able
advocate in New York, and should he pursue the right path,
there may be still hopes of his reformation.
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Herman.</speaker><p>[<hi rend='italic'>Without.</hi>] My father, you say, is this way?
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Derric.</speaker><p>What voice is that; my son? What can have recalled
him thus suddenly? Some new misadventure.&mdash;Oh, my
forboding thoughts!

</sp>

<p rend="action">
<hi rend='italic'>Enter</hi> <name>Herman.</name>
</p>

<sp>
<speaker>Derric.</speaker><p>Herman, what brings you back? Are all my cautions
thus lightly regarded, that they can take no hold upon your
conduct?
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Herman.</speaker><p>You have good cause for warmth, sir, but learn the
reason of my disobedience, ere you condemn. Business of importance
has urged me hither&mdash;such as concerns us both most intimately.
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Derric.</speaker><p>Some fresh extravagance, no doubt, to drain my
little left, and set a host of creditors loose upon me.
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Herman.</speaker><p>Not so, sir, but the reverse. List! you know our
neighbour, Rip Van Winkle?
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Derric.</speaker><p>Know him? Aye, his idleness is proverbial; you
have good cause to recollect him too, since 'twas by his courage
your life was preserved, when attacked by the famished wolf.
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Herman.</speaker><p>He has a daughter scarcely seven years old; now,
the attorney whom I serve has been employed to draw up the
will and settle the affairs of this girl's aunt, who, for some slight
offered by Van Winkle, has long since discarded the family. At
her death, the whole of her immense wealth, in cash and land, is
the inheritance of the girl, who is, at this moment, the richest
presumptive heiress in the land.
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Derric.</speaker><p>What connection can Van Winkle's fortune have
with ours?
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Herman.</speaker><p>Listen! Were it possible to procure his signature to
a contract that his daughter, when of age, should be married to
me, on this security money might be raised by us to any amount.
Now, my good father, am I comprehensible?
</p>
</sp>


<pb n="049"/><anchor id="Pg049"/>

<sp>
<speaker>Derric.</speaker><p>Truly, this seems no visionary dream, like those in
which, with fatal pertinacity, you have so oft indulged; and, on
recollection, the rent of his tenement is in arrears; 'twill offer
favourable opportunity for my calling and sounding him; the
contract must be your care.
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Herman.</speaker><p>'Tis already prepared and lacks only his signature.&mdash;[<hi rend='italic'>Presenting
it.</hi>] Lawyers, who would do justice to their clients,
must not pause at conscience; 'tis entirely out of the question
when their own interest is concerned.
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Derric.</speaker><p>Herman, I like not this black-leg manner of proceeding:
yet it augurs thou wilt be no pettifogger. I'll to Van
Winkle straight and, though not legalized to act, yet in this case
I can do work which honest lawyers would scorn.       [<hi rend='italic'>Exit.</hi>
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Herman.</speaker><p>[<hi rend='italic'>Solus.</hi>] True; the honest lawyer lives by his reputation,
and therefore pauses to undertake a cause he knows unjust:
but how easily are some duped. Can my father for a
moment suppose that the rank weeds of youth are so easily
uprooted? No! what is to be done, good father of mine, but to
serve myself? young men of the present generation cannot live
without the means of entering into life's varieties and this supply
will henceforth enable me to do so, to the fullest extent of my
ambitious wishes.                                   [<hi rend='italic'>Exit.</hi>

<p>Enter <name>Nicholas Vedder</name> and <name>Dame Vedder</name> (<hi rend='italic'>formerly</hi> <name>Dame van Winkle</name>).
</p>
<lg>
<l><name>Dame.</name> 'Tis very hard for the poor girl.</l>
<l><name>Vedder.</name> Yes; but 'tis your fault. You shouldn't have had a fool and a sot for your first husband.</l>
<l><name>Dame.</name> [<hi rend='italic'>Aside.</hi>] And I didn't ought to have had a bear for my second.</l>
<l><name>Vedder.</name> What did you say?</l>
<l><name>Dame.</name> Nothing&mdash;nothing.</l>
<l><name>Vedder.</name> Well, don't say it again. Because Lowena will have to be the wife of Herman Van Slaus, that's settled!</l>
<l><name>Dame.</name> But he's a most disreputable man, and my poor child detests him.</l>
<l><name>Vedder.</name> Well, she won't be the first wife that has detested her husband.</l>
<l><name>Dame.</name> No; I should think not, indeed.</l>
<l><name>Vedder.</name> You should think not! What do you mean by that?</l>
<l><name>Dame.</name> Nothing!</l>
<l><name>Vedder.</name> Well, don't mean it again. What, do you suppose that I'll suffer my daughter-in-law to sacrifice her fortune&mdash;a fortune of which we shall have our share?&mdash;Herman has promised that.</l>
<l><name>Dame.</name> Herman will promise anything; and you know that my poor girl is doatingly fond of young Gustaffe.</l>
<l><name>Vedder.</name> Well, I can't help that; but I am not going to allow her to make a beggar of herself and us too, for any nonsense about the man of her heart.</l>
<l><name>Dame.</name> <corr sic="Her's">Hers</corr> will break if she is compelled to&mdash;</l>
<l><name>Vedder.</name> Nonsense&mdash;a woman's heart is about the toughest object in creation.</l>
<l><name>Dame.</name> You have given me plenty of proof that you think so.</l>
<l><name>Vedder.</name> What do you intend to imply by that?</l>
<l><name>Dame.</name> Nothing!</l>
<l><name>Vedder.</name> Well, don't imply it again&mdash;don't, because&mdash;</l>

<lg>
<l><name>Knickerbocker.</name> Halloa! what's going on&mdash;a matrimonial tiff? My wife has just been giving me a few words, because I told her that she waddles up and down, and rolls about like one of our butter-laden luggers in a squall, as the Dutchmen have it.</l>
<l><name>Alice.</name> You have no occasion to talk, Mr. Knickerbocker, for, I am sure, your corporation&mdash;</l>
<l><name>Knickerbocker.</name> Yes, I belong to the town corporation, and to look respectable, am obliged to have one of my own. Master Vedder, a word with you. [<hi rend='italic'>Talks aside with him.</hi></l>
<l><name>Alice.</name> [<hi rend='italic'>Going to</hi> <name>Dame.</name>] You wish now, that my poor brother Rip hadn't died, don't you?</l>
<l><name>Dame.</name> [<hi rend='italic'>Sighing.</hi>] But I thought Nicholas Vedder would have been just as easy to manage: he was as mild as a dove before our marriage.</l>
<l><name>Alice.</name> You ought to have known that to be allowed to wear the inexpressibles by two husbands was more than the most deserving of our sex had any right to expect.</l>
<l><name>Dame.</name> Oh, dear me! I never thought that I should live to be any man's slave.</l>
<l><name>Alice.</name> Ah, we never know what we may come to! but your fate will be a warning and example for me, if Mr. Knickerbocker should take it into his head to leave me a widow.</l>
<l><name>Vedder.</name> Mrs. Vedder, what are you whispering about there?</l>
<l><name>Dame.</name> Nothing!</l>
<l><name>Vedder.</name> Well, don't whisper it any more.</l>
<l><name>Alice.</name> [<hi rend='italic'>Aside</hi>, to <name>Dame.</name>] Come along with me.</l>
<l><name>Vedder.</name> Mrs. Vedder, take yourself out of the room.</l>

<l><name>Vedder.</name> Yes; and Herman is resolute, and so am I.</l>
<l><name>Knickerbocker.</name> I am sorry for poor Lowena.</l>
<l><name>Vedder.</name> She shouldn't have had a fool for a father.</l>
<l><name>Knickerbocker.</name> It was unfortunate, but I can't exactly see that it was her fault.                        [<hi rend='italic'>Exeunt.</hi></l>

side, like one of our butter-laden luggers in a squall, as the Dutchmen
have it. Ah, Lorrenna, you here? but you appear more depressed

anxious for your happiness!

can be vainly disputed. A vain and idle dispute of
justice.

<sp>
<speaker>Knickerbocker.</speaker><p>Precious fine, indeed, sir,&mdash;but, my ward
has a mighty strong reluctance to part with her fortune, and
much more so to make you her partner for life. You are not
exactly to her liking, nor to her in the world's generally.

his error in judgement. I happened to be a cabinet councillor

<speaker>Herman.</speaker><p>Sir, I came here, not to meet insult; I came hither,
persuaded you would acknowledge my right, and to prevent a
publicity that may be painful to both parties. You are inclined

knowing my claims, Mr. Knickerbocker, know well that Lorrenna

Whosoever of those contracted, fails in fulfilling this agreement,

But here's a codicil. <q>Should the said Rip Van Winkle think fit
to annul this contract within twenty years and a day, he shall be
at full liberty to do so.  (Signed) Derric Van Slaus.</q>
The document is perfect in every form. Rip Van Winkle, 'tis
stated, is defunct. Is there any one present to prove his signature?

my veracity? How was that bond obtained?
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Herman.</speaker><p>Why should you ask? The late Rip Van Winkle,
anxious for the prosperity of his offspring, though too indolent
to provide for their subsistence, persuaded my deceased father
to form this alliance.

swayed by such proceedings.
